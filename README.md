The purpose of this Static Web App example is to demo a couple things: 
- Bring Your Own Functions: to demo this functionality, deploy the code that is in the FunctionAppCode-DeploySeparately folder separately, to a Node.js Function App. See [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/functions-bring-your-own) on how to configure Bring Your Own Functions to use your Function App as a backend API for your Static Web App. Don't try to use Managed Functions in combination with Bring Your Own Functions (ie don't rename the api_ folder to api if you are using Bring Your Own Functions).
- Managed Functions: to demo this functionality, rename the api_ folder to api. Don't try to use Managed Functions in combination with Bring Your Own Functions.
- Custom authentication: Rename the staticwebapp.config-aadauth.json to staticwebapp.config.json and see [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-custom?tabs=aad).
- Built-in authentication: Rename the staticwebapp.config-builtinauth.json to staticwebapp.config.json and see the [Authentication and authorization for Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/authentication-authorization?tabs=invitations) and [Securing routes with roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#securing-routes-with-roles) documentation.
